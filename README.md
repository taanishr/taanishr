## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here's what I'm currently interested in and/or working on:
Projects:
- Fullstack apps w/ typescript (accelarch.com, secret project)
- ML Inference w/ python and rust (secret project)
- Graphics programming w/ Metal and ML optimization w/ CUDA in c++ (metal-playground, research work)
- Database and systems programming in c++ (persistent-queue)

  (a secret project isn't actually secret; the repo is just private and I haven't launched a landing page for it)
